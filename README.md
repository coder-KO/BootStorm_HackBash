## Problem
There are numerous threats that are hanging over our heads like ‘phishing’, ‘scamming’, ‘forgery’, ‘counterfeiting’, but the biggest one among them all is document fraud. Document fraud is fast becoming one of the largest criminal industry in the world. In 2016, 64 percent of decision makers in businesses said that their agendas include the management of document frauds. People reported losing more than $117 million to this type of scam in just the first six months of 2020 compared to $134 million for all of 2019, according to the FTC's latest Consumer Protection Data Spotlight

## Solution
The key issues in document verification for banks and other businesses are in storage, retrieval and access to data. Hence came blockchain technology to solve these problems in storing and accessing of data. Blockchain technology provides a common shared platform from where to store, retrieve and access documents. The very nature of the technology is in the distributed, shared, open ledgers, verifiable by all.

Hence we made Docufied. A blockchain based web application where organisations can register and verify legitimate documents issued by them. These documents can then be verified by anyone from anywhere easily by straightaway using the verification tool of Docufied. Thus detecting even the smallest change in files and tell whether they are original or counterfeit.
